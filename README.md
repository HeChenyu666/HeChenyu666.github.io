# NumberGuess
This is Daniel's website repository. It is mainly used to show the static html web for customers to view and see.
But also, the programme designer will certainly publish the application and may put his sources(Visual Studio,MFC,C++) on it.
In addition, you can also find some useful blogs on the website:http://hechenyu666.github.io
Here comes the result, this is the paradise of Daniel's dream, 
ENJOY THE NUMBERGUESS!
