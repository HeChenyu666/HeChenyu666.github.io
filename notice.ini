text=Welcome to Daniel's NumberGuess! Here I'd like to share you about the recipe for success. If you want to know more, view it on https://blog.sjx0.tk.
rule=Players have 10 numbers from 0 to 10. Players can input 5 numbers in your guess's edit control (all are zero by default, and the range is 0 to 10. If the input exceeds the range, a message box will pop up to remind them). For these 5 numbers, you can input different choices or the same number. After input, click button "done" to judge and display final correct and correct number.
